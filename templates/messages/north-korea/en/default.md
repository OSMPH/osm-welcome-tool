Hello, {{ mapper.displayName }}

Congratulations on your first contribution to OpenStreetMap in North Korea! Thank you for helping us to improve the map.

I'm {{ app.user.displayName }}, an OpenStreetMap contributor on North Korea. We are helping cartographers who are interested in mapping in this country to participate in enriching the map. 

If you have any questions, we can help you: if you think you've made a mistake, if you're not sure how to map something, or if you just want to know more about OpenStreetMap, contact us. There is a [Discord chat room](https://discord.gg/q6HnfNZ) where questions from beginners are welcome. Don't be afraid to reply to this message to get in touch with me, or check out [other channels]( https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/North_Korea_Mapping_Guide#Community).

Here are some tips to get you started:

* While our editing tools try to make it easy to map things, our [wiki](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/) has a lot more detail, you can find a lot of information on how to map there, including this [North Korea specific guide](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/North_Korea_Mapping_Guide).  
If you want to know how to "tag" something, the easiest solution is probably to search with your favourite search engine like this: `site:wiki.openstreetmap.org [search term]` ;
* When you save your changes, add a short but explicit comment about what you have changed ([More information here]( https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Good_changeset_comments);
* Make sure roads are connected to each other but do not connect them to fields or residential areas or other land use information;
* To get an overview of what's going on in the world, sign up for the [OpenStreetMap World Weekly Newsletter](https://weeklyosm.eu/en/);
* You have a record of what you've edited with the [how you contributed tool](https://hdyc.neis-one.org/);

We have a page on our wiki to help you get started. For more tips and tricks, [look here](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Beginners%27_guide)!

Happy Mapping!
